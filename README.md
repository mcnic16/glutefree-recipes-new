<h1 align="center">Gluten-Free Recipes</h1>

[View live project]

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project, is a Gluten-Free recipe database where you can can enter your recipes on the home page, and they will show on the appropriate pages, i.e Starters , Mains etc.
There is also the option to edit or delete these recipes.
I chose this project because a family member has celiac disease and has to maintian a gluten-free diet. 
I had planned to add a search bar and authentication but time was against me, as I had technical problems with deploying to Heroku, so the Frontend is done but I ran out of time to complete the back-end.
